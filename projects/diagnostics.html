    <h1>Diagnosing Small Engines</h1>
    <p>I am documenting my diagnostic process because it something I can write a lot about.</p>

    <h2>When an engine wont crank</h2>
    <p>If you properly prime and/or choke the machine and it doesn't crank, it's one of three things.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gas</li>
      <li>Compression</li>
      <li>Spark</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gas</h3>
    <p>If you put a bit of gas or staring fluid through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carburetor" target="_blank">carburetor</a> into the head, and then it starts its not getting the right gas to air mixture. The carburetor may not be letting the right amount of gas into the head or a clogged as line or a bug on top of the hole in the gas tank might not be letting gas to the carburetor.</p>

    <h3>Compression</h3>
    <p>A machine has to have enough compression to run in the head. If a machine has overhead valves(OHV) it doesn't reQuire as much compression to run. The only accurate way to check compression is with a special tool.</p>

    <p>If a machine has low compression its either the valves, the timing key way or cracked piston or block.</p>

    <h3>Spark</h3>
    <p>A spark tester is useful for telling if there's something wrong with the coil, but it wont tell you if the spark plug is sparking. You can put the spark plug into the boot and not into the head and have a friend hold it with rubber handled channel lock pliers. When you pull the cord or turn the engine with a key, your friend should be able to see if the spark plug is firing or not.</p>
